# Basic-SVG-Diagram-Editor
An implementation of a basic diagramming editor with draggable shapes and lines connecting them. A palette of different shapes (e.g. rects/ellipses/other polygon) that can be added to the canvas through (e.g.) drag and drop and a UI allowing connectors to be added to link pairs of shapes.
